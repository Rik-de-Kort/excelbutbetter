# Excel-but-better Prototype
The idea is harness the power of Python with a good Excel-interop story. We have to provide version control, facilities for more structured processing (I'm thinking building a "formula library" and laying out dataframes in the spreadsheet).

First milestone: spreadsheet application which takes SQLite database and displays the tables.
